Particular interest will be taken in neighborhoods where there are **no take-out restaurants nearby**. We would also prefer to be **within a neighborhood of high density** with respect to others in Kings Cty.\n\nData science skills will be used to produce a list of a few locations that meet these critera. Each proposed location will be clearly described in terms of the findings of this exploration to assist stakeholders in making the best possible decision in final location.\n\n\n#### Target Audience ####\n* Restauranteurs\n* Investors\n* Real Estate Developers\n"

The address of each will be determined with **OpenStreetMap's Reverse geocoding API**\n* The number of, and distance to, restaurants in a neighborhood will be found with **Foursquare's API**\n* The population of each neighborhood will be estimated with data from the **US Dept.of Commerce's Census API**.\n"
